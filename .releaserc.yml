# Boilerplate semantic-release configuration for an Obsidian plugin
# run semantic-release as follows to release a new version of your plugin:
#   dry-run (default):  npx -p github:brianrodri/semantic-release-obsidian-plugin semantic-release
#   for real: npx -p github:brianrodri/semantic-release-obsidian-plugin semantic-release --dry-run false
# If `package.json` has a `repository` key configured, but you want to work on, say, a fork or development version on your own
# repository / user, you might have to specify the `repositoryUrl`:
# - either as a command-line argument (e.g. -r <url>) or by uncommenting and modifying the following line:
# repositoryUrl: https://github.com/<user>/<repository>
